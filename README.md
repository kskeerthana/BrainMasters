## Important Notes

- **Instagram Rate Limits**: Be careful not to exceed Instagram's rate limits (approximately 100-150 actions per day for new accounts)
- **Start Small**: Begin with lower engagement numbers (5-10 per day) and gradually increase
- **Authenticity**: Ensure your comments sound natural and relevant to avoid being flagged as spam
- **Use a VPN**: Consider using a VPN that matches your account's usual location
- **Regular Monitoring**: Check the dashboard regularly to ensure the bot is functioning correctly

## Security Considerations

- Store your credentials securely and never share your `.env` files
- Regularly update your Instagram password
- Monitor your account for any unusual activity
- Consider using a dedicated Instagram account for testing before using your main account

## Troubleshooting

- **Instagram Login Issues**: If you encounter login problems, try logging in manually first or check if Instagram is requiring additional verification
- **API Rate Limits**: If you hit OpenAI rate limits, consider upgrading your API plan or adjusting the bot's scheduling
- **Database Connection**: Ensure MongoDB is running before starting the backend
